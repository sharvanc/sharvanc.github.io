<br>

I am a Data Scientist II at **[Honeywell](https://www.honeywell.com/in/en)**. I am primarily interested in reinforcement learning, language models, and reasoning.

Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist at **[ZS Associates](https://www.zs.com/india)** after completing my dual degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) from **[IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/)**.

My interests are mainly in  _understanding how to reason with language models_. A few core machine learning topics that excite me are as follows:

- Reasoning with language models (like inference time compute)
- Reinforcement learning, self-play (like Alpha Go)
- Multi-modal language models (Speech/Vision)
- Probabilistic modeling, uncertainty estimation, and Bayesian methods

## Project Highlights

**GenAI Workbench**: Built a GenAI-powered analytics platform for interactive querying and visualization from various data sources (Tabular/PDFs/Web).

**Web Q&A**: Developed a perplexity-like web research functionality that can provide rich responses to user queries using real-time web search.

**PDF to Structured Data Pipeline**: Converted complex PDF data into Markdown format using VLMs (GPT-4o) for seamless content analysis.
